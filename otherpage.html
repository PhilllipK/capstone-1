    <h1>Why Venus?<h1>
      <p>One layer of Venus's atmosphere has Earthlike conditions which can be inhabited through flying cities/buildings. Additionally, the only Reason Venus is uninhabitable is because of its greenhouse gas atmosphere. While Mars is unhabitable for various reasons such as unstable temperatures, poor atmosphere and dust.</p>
